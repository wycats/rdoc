= RDoc

* http://rubyforge.org/projects/rdoc/

== DESCRIPTION:

RDoc is an application that produces documentation for one or more Ruby source
files.  RDoc includes the `rdoc` and `ri` tools for generating and displaying
online documentation.

At this point in time, RDoc 2.x is a work in progress and may incur further
API changes beyond what has been made to the RDoc 1.0.1.  Command-line tools
are largely unaffected, but internal APIs may shift rapidly.

== SYNOPSIS:

  gem 'rdoc'
  require 'rdoc/rdoc'
  # ... see RDoc

== BUGS:

If you found a bug, please report it at the RDoc project's tracker on
