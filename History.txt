=== 2.x / ??
* N Minor Enhancements
  * RDoc now adds the package title to the web pages that it generates
    for files and classes/modules, which helps them appear better in
    search engine results.

* N Bug fixes:
  * Fixed prototype detection in C parser.  Can process ruby 1.8 C files
    again.
  * Fix main page for frameless template.  Patch by Marcin Raczkowski.

=== 2.1.0 / 2008-07-20

* 3 Major Enhancements:
  * RDoc now knows about meta-programmed methods, see RDoc::Parser::Ruby
  * Reorganized parsers under RDoc::Parser base class
  * ri now walks the ancestors of a class looking for a method e.g. ri
    File#read displays documentation for IO#read (may require regeneration of
    ri data)
* 5 Minor Enhancements:
  * Allow links to files
  * Default options now taken from RDOCOPT environment variable
  * Class method documentation can be found at toplevel now (def X.foo)
  * Allow HTML templates distributed as gems to be loaded with the -T option,
    just like the standard templates in rdoc/generator/html (so an HTML
    template lib/new_template.rb in a gem can be used with rdoc -T new_template)
  * `rdoc -v` prints out files, classes, modules and methods as it goes
